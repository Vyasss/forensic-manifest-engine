Forensic Manifest: Verifiable AI-Generated Content (AIGC) Forensics EngineForensic Manifest is an advanced, multi-modal digital evidence platform engineered to solve the rapidly escalating threat of AI-driven financial fraud across high-volume commerce sectors. Our mission is to move beyond simple, vulnerable classification models to establish a verifiable forensic reasoning engine capable of generating high-integrity proof necessary for automated, high-stakes commercial decision-making.The system is designed to function as a crucial, trusted oracle, generating cryptographically durable evidence that ensures financial integrity and prevents fraudulent refund claims across e-commerce, food delivery, and logistics platforms.Problem Solved: Mitigating Refund Fraud in High-Volume CommerceE-commerce, food delivery, and logistics companies face significant, avoidable financial losses due to malicious actors leveraging generative AI to submit fraudulent refund requests. This fraud is executed through two primary methods:Fabricated Evidence: Using sophisticated AI models to generate highly realistic, synthetic images of damaged goods, broken packaging, or spoiled food, mimicking genuine proof of loss.Forensic Trace Destruction: Submitting these images through highly lossy compression channels (e.g., low-resolution uploads, messaging apps) to intentionally obscure the subtle forensic artifacts left by the generative process.Traditional, single-method detection systems are consistently defeated by this combination of high-quality synthesis and malicious degradation, leading to unwarranted financial losses, inconsistent enforcement, and compromised platform integrity. Forensic Manifest directly counters this threat by providing an indisputable, evidence-based assessment of the media's authenticity.Unique Innovation: Architecting Verifiable TrustTo counter sophisticated, AI-driven fraud, Forensic Manifest leverages a convergence of state-of-the-art AI and forensic science. We prioritize transparency and reliability to ensure every piece of evidence is justifiable and auditable.FeatureScientific MechanismStrategic Value for E-commerceVLM-Driven InterpretabilityIntegration of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) (e.g., gemini_vlm.py) to generate contextual, natural-language explanations of forgery traces.1Converts a technical finding into a definitive, auditable, and human-readable reason for justifying a refund denial or approval.Multi-Modal Forensic FusionCombines both classical and modern forensic techniques (PRNU analysis, Error Level Analysis (ELA), and Frequency Analysis) to identify a wider spectrum of artifacts left by both AI and traditional manipulation.Enhances the system's ability to resist common adversarial attacks and compression by fusing multiple independent detection signals.Semantic Grounding & TraceabilityA VLM-guided mechanism that maps localized, machine-detected anomalies to human-interpretable concepts (e.g., "Implausible texture consistency in food" or "Unnatural edge transitions").3Provides the transparent traceability required for internal auditing, policy enforcement, and formal dispute resolution.C2PA Assertion GenerationDesigned to package forensic findings into a cryptographically signed C2PA Assertion, ensuring the evidence of forgery is tamper-evident.5Creates legally durable evidence, reducing corporate liability and building trust in automated refund decisions.Project Status: Developing (Focus on Robustness)Forensic Manifest is currently in the active development phase. The architectural core, which includes multi-modal forensic fusion and VLM-based reasoning, is established and being optimized.The immediate roadmap is heavily focused on achieving extreme robustness and scientific generalizability. We are actively refining the feature extraction and reasoning protocols to ensure the system can reliably distinguish subtle AI artifacts from noise introduced by common degradation (compression, filters, etc.), which is the primary challenge for this high-volume fraud detection scenario.Technology Stack and File StructureThe project utilizes a high-performance Python environment structured for scalability and maintainability, separating core logic into distinct service and analysis layers.CategoryModule/ToolPurposeAI Reasoning Coreai/gemini_vlm.pyImplementation of the Vision-Language Model (VLM) for semantic grounding and transparent reasoning generation.Forensic Fusionforensics/prnu_analyzer.pyPhoto Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) analysis module.Forensic Fusionforensics/ela_analyzer.pyError Level Analysis (ELA) module for detecting re-saving and tampering.Forensic Fusionforensics/frequency_analyzer.pyHigh-frequency signal analysis to detect generative model artifacts.API Frameworkmain.py, schemas.py, services.pyFastAPI application for high-throughput, asynchronous service hosting (ASGI).DeploymentUvicorn, Gradio, Python venvHigh-performance ASGI server, rapid prototyping UI, and isolated environment management.File Structure Overview.

About the AuthorForensic Manifest was conceptualized and developed by:Chetan Vyas linkedin.com/in/chetanvyas20Getting StartedPrerequisitesPython 3.9+Uvicorn (ASGI server)1. Environment SetupBash# 1. Create and activate the virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install dependencies (requires Uvicorn for deployment)
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install "uvicorn[standard]"
2. Running the ServerTo run the application and expose it to your local network for internal testing and rapid iteration, use the 0.0.0.0 host binding:Bash# Run the application:
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
Accessing the Application:To test on a mobile device or separate machine (on the same Wi-Fi network):Determine your computer's local IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100).Open the browser on the testing device:Frontend: http://<Your_Local_IP>:8000API Docs: http://<Your_Local_IP>:8000/docs
